Eirik will tell the story of when he learned to program -- using Adobe Flash in high school, with Gl√∏er as his teacher. The two reconnected ten years later over their love of Svelte -- and convinced Norway's largest text book publisher, Cappelen Damm, to use Svelte to teach programming to the next generation of high schoolers. The talk will show interactive examples from their upcoming book.</p><p>Making programming fun and lowering the barrier to entry is an important step in getting enough programmers to meet demand in the near future. First impressions are important, and Svelte is sure to impress.</p>"

What if we applied the same principles to other facets of app development? Are there other pieces of apps that can be analyzed ahead of time to optimize it further.</p><p>It turns out the answer is yes, and I created https://github.com/cibernox/rollup-plugin-precompile-intl to demonstrate it.</p>"

And unlike the state-of-the-art framework, Electron, NodeGUI is lightweight, as it renders a native UI rather than hosting its UI in a web browser.</p><p>Svelte NodeGUI takes the project further by implementing a Svelte renderer for NodeGUI, abstracting away much of the learning curve of Qt and allowing you to write a NodeGUI app with about as easily as if you were writing a web app!</p>"
